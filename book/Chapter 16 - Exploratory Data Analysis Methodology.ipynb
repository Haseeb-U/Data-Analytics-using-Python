    "## Introduction: What EDA Is (and What It Is Not)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What EDA Is\n",
    "EDA is a set of techniques to:\n",
    "- **Understand columns** — their meaning, types, and value ranges\n",
    "- **Find data quality issues early** — missing values, duplicates, inconsistent entries\n",
    "- **Discover relationships** — does discount affect returns? does age relate to spending?\n",
    "- **Spot patterns and anomalies** — unusual spikes, clusters, or outliers worth investigating\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA was popularized by statistician John Tukey in the 1970s. His philosophy: let the data speak before imposing assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What EDA Is Not\n",
    "EDA is **not proof of causation**. During EDA you generate ideas and hypotheses. You then validate them later with careful statistics, experiments, or domain expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "| EDA Tells You | EDA Does NOT Tell You |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| \"Sales are higher on weekends\" | \"Weekends *cause* higher sales\" |\n",
    "| \"Discount and returns are correlated\" | \"Discounts *lead to* more returns\" |\n",
    "| \"There are 5 outlier transactions\" | \"These outliers are errors vs real\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Tip:** Think of EDA as turning on the lights before you start working. You see what's in the room, but you still need to investigate each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why EDA Matters\n",
    "- **Saves time later:** Catching data issues early prevents wrong conclusions\n",
    "- **Guides analysis:** EDA reveals which variables are worth deeper study\n",
    "- **Builds intuition:** You develop a \"feel\" for the data that helps with modeling decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Common Beginner Mistake:** Jumping straight to complex models without understanding the data first. This often leads to wasted effort and wrong results."

    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **EDA is a method, not random plotting.** Follow a consistent workflow to ensure you don't miss important findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Start with inspection and minimal cleanup.** Understand your data before diving into analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Progress from simple to complex:** Univariate → Bivariate → Multivariate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Combine visuals with statistics.** Plots help you see patterns; statistics help you quantify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Outliers are leads to investigate** — not automatically errors to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **EDA helps refine hypotheses** into precise, testable questions for later validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Correlation ≠ Causation.** EDA finds associations; proving causes requires further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The EDA Checklist (Quick Reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ☐ Clarify the goal\n",
    "2. ☐ Inspect dataset (shape, types, missing)\n",
    "3. ☐ Clean just enough for exploration\n",
    "4. ☐ Univariate analysis\n",
    "5. ☐ Bivariate analysis\n",
    "6. ☐ Multivariate analysis\n",
    "7. ☐ Pattern and anomaly detection\n",
    "8. ☐ Refine hypotheses\n",
    "9. ☐ Summarize insights\n",

    "### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mistake | Why It's a Problem | Solution |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Skipping inspection | Wrong data types → wrong calculations | Always check `.dtypes` and `.isna()` first |\n",
    "| Over-cleaning early | You miss seeing real data issues | Clean minimally for EDA; deep clean later |\n",
    "| Assuming causation | Leads to wrong decisions | Note associations only; test causes separately |\n",
    "| Ignoring outliers | Miss important insights or errors | Flag and investigate, don't auto-remove |\n",
    "| No documentation | Can't reproduce or explain findings | Write notes as you go |\n",
