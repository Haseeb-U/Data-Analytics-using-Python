    "- Deal with authentication, rate limits, and errors\n",

    "## 10.2 REST API Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. It's a way for programs to talk to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use an app on your phone to check the weather, that app is making an **API call** to a weather service to get the data. We can do the same thing with Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is REST?\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST** (Representational State Transfer) is the most common style for web APIs. Almost every API you'll encounter as a data analyst follows REST principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a REST API like a restaurant:\n",
    "- The **menu** = API documentation (tells you what's available)\n",
    "- Your **order** = API request (what you want)\n",
    "- The **waiter** = HTTP protocol (delivers your request)\n",
    "- Your **food** = API response (the data you receive)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key REST Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Endpoints (URLs)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **endpoint** is a specific URL that gives you access to a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://api.example.com/weather         ← Get weather data\n",
    "https://api.example.com/users           ← Get user data\n",
    "https://api.example.com/products/123    ← Get product #123\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. HTTP Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The **method** tells the API what you want to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Purpose | Analogy |\n",
    "|--------|---------|---------|\n",
    "| `GET` | Read/retrieve data | \"Show me the menu\" |\n",
    "| `POST` | Create new data | \"Place a new order\" |\n",
    "| `PUT` | Update existing data | \"Change my order\" |\n",
    "| `DELETE` | Remove data | \"Cancel my order\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **For data analytics, you'll use `GET` 99% of the time** because you're reading data, not creating or modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Query Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters** filter or customize your request. They appear after a `?` in the URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://api.example.com/weather?city=London&units=metric\n",
    "                               └─────────┴───────────────┘\n",
    "                                   Query parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Status Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "The server responds with a **status code** telling you what happened:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Code | Meaning | What to Do |\n",
    "|------|---------|------------|\n",
    "| **200** | ✅ Success | Process the data |\n",
    "| **400** | ❌ Bad request | Check your parameters |\n",
    "| **401** | 🔐 Unauthorized | Check your API key |\n",
    "| **403** | 🚫 Forbidden | You don't have permission |\n",
    "| **404** | ❓ Not found | Check the endpoint URL |\n",
    "| **429** | ⏱️ Rate limited | Slow down, wait before retrying |\n",
    "| **500** | 💥 Server error | Try again later |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning:** Always set a **timeout** on your requests. Without it, your code can hang forever if the server doesn't respond!"

    "- ❌ Crash on network errors\n",
    "- ❌ Produce confusing error messages\n",

    "Let's build a **safe helper function** that handles these issues.\n",

    "1. **📋 Check Terms of Service (ToS)**\n",
    "   - Many sites explicitly prohibit scraping\n",
    "   - Violating ToS can have legal consequences\n",

    "   - Not legally binding, but a strong ethical guideline\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **⏱️ Respect rate limits**\n",
    "   - Add delays between requests (at least 1 second)\n",
    "   - Don't overload servers\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **🆔 Identify yourself**\n",
    "   - Use a reasonable User-Agent header\n",
    "   - Include contact info if doing research\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **🔒 Avoid personal data**\n",
    "   - Don't scrape emails, names, or private information\n",
    "   - Consider GDPR and other privacy regulations\n",

    "#### 1. 🔒 Privacy and Consent\n",
    "- Avoid collecting personal data without explicit consent\n",
    "- Consider: \"Would this person expect their data to be collected?\"\n",
    "- Be especially careful with sensitive data (health, finances, etc.)\n",

    "- Many prohibit automated access or commercial use\n",
    "- Violations can lead to legal action\n",

    "# Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we covered in this chapter\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1 Types of Data Sources\n",
    "- Data comes from files, databases, APIs, web pages, and logs\n",
    "- Structured → Semi-structured → Unstructured spectrum\n",
    "- **Always prefer APIs over scraping when available**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.2 REST API Fundamentals\n",
    "- REST APIs use endpoints (URLs), HTTP methods, parameters, and status codes\n",
    "- GET method is used for reading data (most common in analytics)\n",
    "- Status codes tell you if requests succeeded or failed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.3 Making API Requests\n",
    "- Use the `requests` library for HTTP calls\n",
    "- **Always set a timeout** to prevent hanging\n",
    "- Use `params={}` instead of building URLs manually\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.4 Authentication and Tokens\n",
    "- Many APIs require API keys or tokens\n",
    "- **Never hard-code secrets in your code**\n",
    "- Use environment variables to store credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.5 Handling JSON and XML\n",
    "- JSON is the modern standard (use `json.loads()`)\n",
    "- XML is more verbose (use `xml.etree.ElementTree`)\n",
    "- Convert API responses to DataFrames for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.6 Web Scraping Principles\n",
    "- Check ToS, robots.txt, and ethical considerations first\n",
    "- Be polite: add delays, respect rate limits\n",
    "- **Scraping is a last resort**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.7 HTML Parsing\n",
    "- BeautifulSoup makes HTML parsing easy\n",
    "- Use `find()` and `find_all()` to navigate the DOM\n",
    "- Clean extracted data (remove currency symbols, convert types)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.8 Dynamic Content\n",
    "- Some pages load content via JavaScript\n",
    "- Try to find the underlying API first\n",
    "- Use Selenium/Playwright as a last resort\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.9 Rate Limits and Error Handling\n",
    "- Build robust code with retries and exponential backoff\n",
    "- Handle specific HTTP errors appropriately\n",
    "- Add polite delays between requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.10 Legal and Ethical Considerations\n",
    "- Respect privacy, ToS, and copyright\n",
    "- Know the regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)\n",
    "- When in doubt, ask for permission\n",

    "1. Combine multiple data sources for richer analysis\n",
    "2. Build automated data pipelines that run on schedules\n",
