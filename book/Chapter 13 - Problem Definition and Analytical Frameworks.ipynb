    "### What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business vs Analytical Problems**\n",
    "   - Business problems are broad and vague; analytical problems are specific and measurable\n",
    "   - Use the template: \"How does [Outcome] change across [Groups] over [Time]?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Objectives and Success Criteria**\n",
    "   - Objectives define direction; success criteria define measurable targets\n",
    "   - Use the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stakeholder Identification**\n",
    "   - Map stakeholders by their decisions, questions, and constraints\n",
    "   - Align on definitions early to avoid miscommunication\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **KPI Definition**\n",
    "   - KPIs are metrics directly tied to objectives\n",
    "   - Define KPIs precisely: name, formula, unit, grain, filters, data source\n",
    "   - Track balanced sets of KPIs to avoid unintended consequences\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hypothesis-Driven Analysis**\n",
    "   - Formulate testable hypotheses before analyzing data\n",
    "   - Structure: \"[Group A] has [higher/lower] [metric] than [Group B]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Project Planning**\n",
    "   - Document problem, objective, stakeholders, KPIs, data needs, timeline, and risks\n",
    "   - Schedule early checkpoints with stakeholders\n",
