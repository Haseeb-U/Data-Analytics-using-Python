    "### Why continuous learning matters\n",
    "- New tools and libraries emerge regularly (e.g., Polars, DuckDB)\n",
    "- Business problems evolve—new domains require new knowledge\n",

    "1. **Master the fundamentals first**\n",
    "   - Strong Python/pandas skills → then explore new libraries\n",
    "   - Solid SQL foundation → then learn advanced techniques\n",
    "   - Basic statistics → then tackle machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learn in layers**\n",
    "   - Week 1-4: Core concepts and syntax\n",
    "   - Month 2-3: Apply to real projects\n",
    "   - Month 4+: Deepen with edge cases and optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Balance breadth and depth**\n",
    "   - **T-shaped skills**: Deep expertise in one area + working knowledge of many\n",
    "   - Example: Expert in Python analytics + familiar with SQL, visualization, cloud basics\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Learn by doing**\n",
